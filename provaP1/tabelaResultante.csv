2,"Turkey",24.63,"This wine made from an aromatic indigenous Turkish grape offers a pleasing aroma of honeydew melon and freesia. It is soft on entry and remains smooth on the palate, with flavors of guava, pineapple and rose petal that meld into a soft floral finish."
3,"Switzerland",85.29,"Vanilla and lemon curd aromas bring nuance and depth to the the complex bouquet of this wine. Full bodied with a silky texture, tones of green apple and mango show bright on the palate, leading to a splash of minerality on the finish."
4,"New Zealand",26.93,"You've got to dig for them a little, but eventually this wine offers aromas of ginger, white flowers and almonds with a whiff of green beans followed by a citrusy, pithy palate. The finish doesn't last as long as you'll wish it did. Nevertheless, this is a solid example of the region's flagship variety."
5,"Italy",39.66,"Zorzettig's precious Picolit dessert wine delivers unique menthol- like tones over dried herbs, almond, honey, pine nut and maple syrup. It's very alive and bright in the mouth and has a distinctive powder-like texture with great intensity on the close."
6,"Uruguay",26.4,"Woody lightly spicy aromas of red fruits are tame and suggestive of fresh mushroom. This is linear and wiry in structure, not deep. Snappy tomato, herb and spiced-plum flavors finish lively, with a salty afertaste."
7,"Hungary",40.65,"White flower and pink bubblegum notes lend a slightly confected tone to this semisweet Hungarian sparkling wine, but it's an undeniably drinkable, peach-flavored sip, with sharp effervescence and a tasty sugar-cookie finish."
8,"US",36.57,"Zucca has made a fragrant and floral Sangiovese Rosato here, dry like cherry jam on toast and a nutty finish. Pair it with tropically seasoned seafood."

14,"Brazil",23.77,"Yeasty briny aromas are a bit pickled and not very fruity. This rosé feels yeasty and not very tight or expressive. Flavors of tropical fruits and melon don't change much on a quick-passing finish."
15,"Austria",30.76,"Zweigelt can do easy-drinking styles but in the right hands, it can also turn into something more elegant. That's the case here: This exudes sophistication.

20,"Canada",35.71,"Young and sharp-toned, this shows a strong streak of oak with a bitter edge to it. More bottle age may help to soften it up a bit, but for now it's all about oak and apple without much else. Cellar it awhile or give it extra aeration."

25,"Spain",28.22,"Zingy and sort of floral on the nose, but fairly pickled, less than pure fruit mars the flavor profile. White wine from La Mancha has never been a Spanish strong suit, and while this wine isn't cloying, sharp or dead on arrival, it doesn't add up to much."
26,"Croatia",25.45,"Yellow freesias, fresh apples and quince preserves perfume this lovely, medium-bodied Malvasia from Istria. Dry on the palate yet elegantly fruity, it balances bright, fresh apple and tangerine flavors with nervy acidity and a lemon pith astringency on the finish."

30,"Greece",22.36,"Zippy, fresh aromas of citrus and white fruit lead the nose. Ripe fruit balanced by good acidity and a lingering, luscious finish make this an exemplary Greek pour. Pair with poultry, grilled seafood or enjoy as an apéritif."
31,"India",13.33,"This wine features a fresh nose of grapefruit and lemon peel. It is bright on the palate, offering flavors of grapefruit, pear and green apple. It remains crisp and clean across the entire tongue right into the orange zest finish."

35,"Chile",20.79,"Zippy, with natural rubbery aromas. This is quite tart and has a personality defined by lemon. There's lemon torte up front, while at the end it's purely tangy and sharp. Not an astringent, scouring wine, but high acidity comes into play."
36,"France",41.14,"Zind-Humbrecht owns some great Grand Cru vineyards, perhaps none more so than the Clos Saint Urbain. This luscious, rich, sweet wine shows both power and intensity without losing any sense of structure. It's young, needing many years to show off its full potential. Drink from 2018."
37,"Slovakia",16.0,"Delicious scents of honey, apples and petrol lead to a luscious, full-bodied palate full of smoke and honey with a gripping lime skin astringency on the finish. Rich in honey tones, yet quite dry, the palate is balanced with a bracing acidity."
38,"Israel",31.77,"Yogev, meaning “tiller of the soil,” is a friendly and easy-pleasing wine, with direct notes of cherry skins, fresh cassis and black currant leaf. Medium weight, with moderate acidity, fine tannins and a clean, fruit-driven finish. Drink now."
39,"Mexico",26.79,"Yeasty aromas are suggestive of vanilla wafer and corn cakes, with apple and melon scents lurking. A plump, low-acid palate delivers pithy, lightly bitter citrus and stone-fruit flavors, while notes of melon and honey fail to make much noise on the finish."
40,"South Africa",24.67,"Zelma Long's tradition of excellence continues with the Series M: Its deep chocolate, cinnamon and berry aromas and full, complex waves of delicious fruit and spice are exactly what a Bordeaux blend should be. Restrained but memorable, the wine has firm structure and will age beautifully."
41,"Peru",18.06,"Stone-fruit and yellow apple aromas come with a hint of ham. Flat and creamy in feel, this tastes almost entirely of leesy vanilla and pithy bitterness. In the folds are bland banana and melon notes."
42,"Lebanon",30.69,"Violet red to the eye, this wine is a blend of 55% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot.

Fruit and spice flavors keep each other in check amid velvety tannins. The smooth cherry finish is highlighted by touches of orange zest."
43,"Bosnia and Herzegovina",12.5,"Toasted oak and cedar notes meld into lush, ripe black plums on the nose and palate of this fruit-forward, richly concentrated wine from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It's a straightforward, accessible wine, but well balanced with smooth tannins and a bright acidity"
